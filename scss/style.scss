/* this file imports all your partials to be compiled into one stylesheet, which you can actually attach to your html.

All the files that are prefixed with an underscore "_name-of-file.scss" are called partials - meaning that their css isnt compile unlessit's imported into an unprefixed .scss file

 Example:
 
 @import 'name-of-file';
